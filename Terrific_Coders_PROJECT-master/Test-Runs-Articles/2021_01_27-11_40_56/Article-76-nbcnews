If the president violates the health guidelines, he's setting a bad example to others," said Ortega, wishing López Obrador a quick recovery.The government said López Obrador's symptoms began on Sunday, but it was not clear exactly when. The president announced his positive test result 6-1/2 hours after the plane from the central city of San Luis Potosi reached the capital.Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, Interior Minister Olga Sanchez and Security Minister Rosa Icela Rodriguez were among top officials who quickly said they had taken tests after his announcement. Others said they would go into self-isolation.Sanchez said the 67-year-old president was feeling well and remained firmly in charge of the government."He will recover soon," she said on Monday, standing in for him at one of the daily news conferences he has used to dominate Mexican politics since taking office just over two years ago.On Monday afternoon, Lopez Obrador was resting at his official residence in the National Palace in Mexico City, still had only mild symptoms and was not receiving additional oxygen, a senior official said.Leading politicians were not the only ones to have been in the president's immediate orbit on his trip.He was at a dinner at the home of his former chief-of-staff Alfonso Romo on Friday night, attended by some of Mexico's top corporate titans. Guests included cement giant Cemex's Chairman Rogelio Zambrano and Armando Garza Sada, chairman of conglomerate Alfa, according to media reports.Cemex did not comment on personal matters, a spokesman said. Alfa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mexico has recorded nearly 150,000 deaths in the pandemic, and Lopez Obrador's crisis management has drawn sustained criticism from political adversaries and medical experts.On Monday, a senior World Health Organization official said the high rate of positive Covid-19 tests in Mexico likely meant the country has been screening too few people.Nevertheless, polls have shown Lopez Obrador's popularity rising in the pandemic, despite accusations he has too often downplayed it and put himself unnecessarily at risk.Roy Campos, head of polling firm Consulta Mitofsky, said the public reaction to the president's Covid-19 diagnosis would likely split along partisan lines, with supporters rallying behind Lopez Obrador and critics going after him.But, with many Mexicans struggling to get medical care due to hospitals being stretched, it could become more of a problem if there were awkward revelations about when the president felt unwell and how he acted thereafter, Campos said.Lopez Obrador found time to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday to agree on Mexico's acquisition of 24 million doses of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine.Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.© 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL
