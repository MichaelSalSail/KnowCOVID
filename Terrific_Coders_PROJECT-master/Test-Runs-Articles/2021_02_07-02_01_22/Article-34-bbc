We shared laughter and tears together."The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of."Whilst he'd been in so many hearts for just a short time, he was an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay alive in our hearts forever."Capt Sir Tom's daughters said the care he received from the NHS was "extraordinary".They said staff had been "unfalteringly professional, kind and compassionate and have given us many more years with him than we ever would have imagined".Capt Sir Tom joined the Army at the beginning of World War Two, serving in India and Myanmar, then known as Burma.He was originally from Keighley in West Yorkshire and among the local tributes being paid was Robbie Moore MP who said the town had "lost one of its finest today".He was made an honorary colonel of the Army Foundation College in Harrogate on his 100th birthday.In December, he went on a family holiday to Barbados after British Airways paid for his flight.Capt Sir Tom had initially set out to raise Â£1,000 for NHS charities by walking 82ft (25m)-loops of his garden.But he eventually raised Â£32,794,701 from more than 1.5 million supporters.NHS Charities Together said that would rise to Â£39m when Gift Aid was taken into account.Ellie Orton, chief executive, said the funds raised by Capt Sir Tom had "reached the length and breadth of the UK through every one of our 241 member charities".She said he was "a one-off and he leaves the world a better place".Ruth May, chief nursing officer for NHS England, said Capt Sir Tom Moore "has been the model of all that has been good about our country's response to Covid-19".She said in a statement "for me his biggest achievement and most important contribution to helping my fellow nurses, doctors and all those in the NHS responding to coronavirus, has been how he brought the country together and gave us all a boost when we most needed it".Fellow charity fundraiser Dabirul Choudhury, who was 100 years old when he  raised more than Â£150,000 for coronavirus relief by walking while fasting for Ramadan, paid tribute to Capt Sir Tom."If you want to help mankind you should keep yourself very fit, fit, fit," he said.Mr Choudrey's son Atique said Capt Sir Tom had "left a massive legacy that will follow on through for generations", adding "even now, my father hasn't actually eaten since he's heard about the news [of Capt Sir Tom's death]".Capt Sir Tom became the oldest person to have a UK number one single when he recorded You'll Never Walk Alone with Michael Ball last year.The singer said on Twitter: "A wonderful life so well lived and a hero and fighter to the very end.
