It is a grand event held in Oslo’s city hall. In a normal year, it would have been filled to capacity, and you would have been greeted by the royal family, the president and the prime minister,” Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said via video link from the Norwegian capital.“Due to coronavirus pandemic, it wasn’t possible to host you in Oslo today.”Instead, WFP Executive Director David Beasley received the prize, medal and diploma at the organization’s headquarters in Rome."Famine is at humanity’s doorstep,” he said, accepting the award. “Because of so many wars, climate change and a global health pandemic that makes all that exponentially worse, 270 million people are marching towards starvation. Failing to address their needs will cause a hunger pandemic which will dwarf the impact of Covid.”Claudio Lavanga is Rome-based producer and correspondent for NBC News.© 2020 NBC UNIVERSAL
