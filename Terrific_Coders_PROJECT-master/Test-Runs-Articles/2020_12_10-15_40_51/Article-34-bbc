It "has been winning for a long time, and I think they're taking [firms] for granted a little bit," he added.Texas might also offer some tax benefits for the world's second-richest man.It does not collect personal income tax, while California has some of the highest state tax rates in the United States.Last month, Mr Musk's net worth jumped by $7.2bn to $128bn after shares in Tesla surged.Only Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is richer, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Coronavirus: Elon Musk vows to move Tesla factory in lockdown rowTech Tent: Is Tesla really worth $500 billion?Elon Musk becomes world's second richest personTesla shrugs off pandemic as sales hit new recordplaySpaceX launch: What is SpaceX and why is it going to the ISS?'Strong possibility' of no trade deal with EU - PMBoris Johnson says negotiations with the EU will continue, but are "not yet there at all".Israel and Morocco agree to normalise relationsplayUS Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered.
