    Margaret Keenan, 90, is applauded by staff as she returns to her ward after becoming the first person in the United Kingdom to receive the Pfizer/BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine.Margaret Keenan, a 90-year old woman from Northern Ireland, on Tuesday became the first person to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outside of clinical trials, marking the start of the UK‚Äôs mass vaccination program as announced last week.Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said, ‚ÄúI feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against COVID-19. It‚Äôs the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year.‚ÄùMeet Maggie: the first person in the world to receive a fully-tested and approved Covid-19 vaccine on the NHS.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt thank May and the NHS staff enough who have looked after me tremendously, and my advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it ‚Äì if I can have it at 90, then you can have it too!‚ÄùShortly after the vaccine was administered to Keenan, a second patient, 81-year-old William Shakespeare from Coventry also received his dosage.Recipients of the vaccine are expected to receive a booster jab in 21 days to ensure their protection against the virus, which has killed 1.54 million people globally.Second patient to get the COVID jab at University Hospital Coventry - would you believe it....William Shakespeare from WarwickshireLast month Pfizer announced promising early results from its coronavirus vaccine trial that suggested the drug was safe and 95% effective at blocking COVID-19. The company said no serious side effects have been observed.The results from the trial, which has recruited 43,000 participants, were based on 170 people who got infected with the coronavirus. Of them, 8 were in the half of study participants who received the vaccine and the other 162 had received placebo shots, pointing to a high statistical significance of the shots' effectiveness.With more than 1.7 million confirmed cases of the virus, the rollout of the vaccine has begun with 70 hospitals and comes just over a week after Britain became the first Western country to approve the drug.Appearing on national television, Britain‚Äôs health minister Matt Hancock was tearful as he acknowledged the journey to reach the moment.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just been such a tough year for so many people and there‚Äôs William Shakespeare putting it so simply for everybody that we can get on with our lives,‚Äù Hancock told hosts on Good Morning Britain.Health Secretary Matt Hancock becomes emotional hearing the words of the first man in the world to receive the vaccine, William Shakespeare. 

He tearily says ‚Äòit makes you so proud to be British‚Äô.
