# Terrific Coders - KnowCOVID


## Overview

KnowCOVID is a news application designed to deliver coronavirus news. Our content
is exclusive to written news articles; news from videos and podcasts are avoided.
Articles are updated each week in order to keep content up-to-date. The news
we provide relates more to the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S rather then
the situation in other countries.
